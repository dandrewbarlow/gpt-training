We bring this for the ones who fiend to see the truth taken back in pain
The weakness of this scene who fucks who lack the nuts to claim
The streets from which that real shit comes to push you up on game
What's your name check it bitch it's Death Grips

Gut around big anti-sleeping no half-stepping low life
Creepin' high-def freaking detonation
Set it off no hesitation audio invasion
But fuck that can't thrust that to a beam
That shit had to go machine that lick
And let 'em blow like cream black it's the magic host
Self ream tactic what's the fuck I mean that shit
All night

Executors of that next shit
Nest eye to the left shit
That melt your face
Till your bloody neck gets ripped headless
Death grips
Bow down and take this what you get bitch
Rest in bits as I pace up and down the low end of the bass
Stomping rounds automatic fire sounds in your face
Rip them fakes out their flesh
Come test this get this straight no escape
Rigor mortis death break
Strung up in the hung wire hell tensity drum
Bitch slap negative space
You thought that it makes through a cut
That bit only info can create
To properly uno dos tr√©s

Ride through your skull

Took hit to the face take way off the hook don't hate
Shook out your footsteps and put back in your place
Triple X heat the rain in which we move
While they choose to get used everyday
Running highs you might break if their own reek of fear
Why you wish we were here
While I say get the fuck out my way
For to get cut by fist gut if you stay

Thought you was on top but not no more
That's right whore we're fucking you
We're fucking you
Thought you knew me had shit locked to the beat street don't stop
Licking shots for the old school freaks doing the robot
Hear this devil spit next lower heat blow it out your spine

Fear high drop to your knees trick you know what we want
That's right bitch best believe this that shit you forgot
Ever was but it is through my blood need that fix
Gotta catch that but lead off that high head row
Give it 'em like it step back 'cause need to rip that watch me bust
Where you going not knowing till we get there jack 'em off of this
The sword what you're holding till you get well
Have to hit 'em off with all you know
And got that gold and make it cracked again
Control this while I hold this enema death takes that my casket in
Growing like oceans epileptic sex can't get passed this shit
Spiraling too much on like king of the cleaners liquid acid trip

What's up with that next shit
It's death grips

Illegal spit fire bum rushing ya tires
This fuck give it up I'm here look don't touch why
We're done and whip that fuck you
I'll cut you don't try it can't deny it
Cracks off every time that you bite it
Try to fuck when I don't buy it

What's up with that next shit
It's death grips

Try to board this train like
What's ya name check it bitch
Jack the rip in a brain
That's just shrunken head trip
What's ya name tic tacking
Just just status

Nuclear fallout flesh in fire in the hole
Death Grips is some thrash it goes right through your skull
<|endoftext|>
Face melter
Cock the barrel, trigger range
Swerving donuts 'gainst the grain
I blame ghost rider, whips the brain
Kaleidoscopic bullet train
Never gave up, just a clutch
Bitch

Burn a bitch and burn that strip to dust
Dust to ashes, ash to mush
Mashed off the madness man, combust
Black magic flames race out because they forgot they can't get down enough
Low to the ground limbo, don't touch this merchandise, it's way too much
Ride the currents like a snake, wicked rhymes
Whirlpools I'll wade through haters, posers, fools, and flakes
Through this breaks the rules it takes
But I not just bump what you waste your time and money tryin' to chase

Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream
(Madness)

Don't trip man, just know we come
And won't even be close to done
Till shit hit the fan and make that flesh melt off your plastic face
Kill it till it dies, don't stop it until you feel that flatline drop
To hell and back, fuck yeah, why not?
(Why not?)
Smash till I break out, can't stop, won't stop, don't stop
Ghosts can't get caught, run it back, get cracked to the beat one time
Get-get-get back, keep in sync rhymes
Endorphins cashed by your own time
I'm coughing, the track freeze and unwind
Weed is of kind vaporize
Freak man down from way this rides, how this rides
Feet don't touch the ground inside, I twist the rhythm pounds 'em on
How measurements of sound rewind
Forever and a day forgot
Forget to let it bang and walk the plank
That hang from slang concocted to destroy the frame got bent by globe
This takes the pain in shock
(Ah!)

Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

Execution makes it hot, electrocute the wave, the shock
To the brains of heads that came to watch us
Claim the game haters can't knock us
Real ones bring that bloody bass, we came to melt your fucking face
You can keep it, I don't want it
Back, my only inside pocket
All up on it, man get off it
Can't you see me? Best to drop it
Cut it, quit it, quick, next topic
How we fuck it off and rock it
Paradox knot, disco sock it
Can't unplug it with your logic
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Fuck it
And unplug it with your -
Take out your eyes and watch it
Make you cry, feel like I lost it
Didn't lose it, never had it
Just another clueless faggot
Bound and gagged by fear
Too pathetic to be tragic
Get that shit outta here

Don't know why you waste your time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

I can't deny I've not the slightest idea why
Even attempt to try
See them sigh
And settle with knowing barely enough to get by
Automatic supernova, so what?
(Automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic)
We'll storm in the gates, subatomic
Flame drippin' onto this coal, setting hellfire to your face

Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter
<|endoftext|>
Hit it, split it, make it cum get wetted,
Come again come get it

Seen it happening before it even happened
Swing the door open and buck 'em down
Course I'm just fuckin' around
But never mind the way it sound
Every time we make it pound
Straight into the pavement now

Whip it, bleed it, cause it pain
Eat it, shit it out and change
Lanes at speeds that seem insane,
To them petty pussy brains
Push me and they will be slain
Drag this past the point and claim
That shit as if it was your name
Like it's attached to yours with chains
Own it till shit goes up in flames

And there really ain't no one to blame

No one to blame, it's all the same
Like blurred faces on subway trains
Can't take it man, can't take the pain

Pain of the game
Makes me insane
Makes me fuck up my whole thang

What'd you bring
Where'd you get it
Give here I said don't sweat it

I'm gonna take it around for a bit
And I don't care if you give a shit
Punk...

I'm gonna take it around for a bit
And I don't care if you give a shit
Punk... bitch...

Goin' through the motions
Just to make shit happen right,
Never knowin' where we're goin'
Just rollin' like waves at night

Make it or break it just don't sleep on it
Sleepers get shot down you lost it,
Trying to act like you got it
Never mind the way it sound
Every time we make it pound
Straight into the pavement now

Shot it up, get it hot, what
I know you know you said too much,
Did too much, way too much
Fuck that shit man that shit sucks

Volume turned all the way up
You already know it's going down

I'll tell you when I've had enough
Shut up right now

Feel it in my gut right now
Throw it up, give it up like oww

Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck blow
Get up... get up...

All over the place, all in your face
All up in it, talkin' bout can't wait,
To bring it even harder the next,
Time I creep through the beat possessed

Howling on that mountain peak
Feeling like hell's up in my chest

Feel the fire rise, rise so high, so high I rise
Eye to eye with death

Gazing through me like an Uzi
Spraying through me bag of flesh

Body bag of flesh
Ain't nothing left
Toe tag me up zip the bag and check it

Oh no he's been resurrected

Get up... get up...

Zombie holocaust in seconds

Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
From what we know, down deep inside

Hell if I know, just wanna ride
Until the wheels, fall off and I
Run off the road, know telling why

Hear them cry

Man I just don't wanna die
Just don't wanna why
Is everything always happening
In the blink of eye
This better be the last time me
Ever see you in my life
Steadily to the death passing
Everything that don't seem tight

Goin' through the motions
Just to make shit happen right
Never knowin' where we're goin'
Just rollin' like waves at night
<|endoftext|>
Known for it... known for it

Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it, till I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was bout ta crash
So I mashed through hit
Known for it
Had ta do it
Hacked into it

I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it... Known for it

Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this

You can tell me what you said - go ahead
But no sooner than you said it,
You can bet it was left for dead
All you said in and out of my head in seconds

Keep 'em guessin' endlessly
Never let 'em know where your headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How ta show 'em they don't mean shit ta me

Never meant a thing to me
Effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy
Extremely selective memory

Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone
Or it'll take everything you own, floor it
Get it, get it

I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it... Known for it

Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this

Known for it since way back, all about it
Never been without it
How ta ride it inside out of da clouded
By the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost don't doubt it
You might just need it

Already did that,
Can't never go back
Yeah fuck that
Gets the bozack

Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don't trip
If ya have one let a man so I could flip a bitch and kill it

Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it ta wind, round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed 'cause I will be damned if mine ever decays

Forever on attack gut check the blind

Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life

'Cause I... am... known for it

Takyon
Tak, takyon (Takyon)
Takyon
Tak, tak

Triple six, five, forked tongue
Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones

Oh shit I'm feeling it, takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it, takyon
All right that's tight, what it's like to experience, takyon

Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like, "Fuck, what was that?"
Man I don't know, but it made me feel so heated how we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know 'cause even if you did, you'd keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat, we make beats catch
Beat it till it bleeds to death, each track, epileptic seize every head we crack
Like EPMD snapping necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map (Takyon)

Oh shit I'm feeling it, takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it, takyon
All right that's tight, what it's like to experience, takyon

Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale till the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird, try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't 'cause it's way too sheer, how to make a hater disappear
Take shit where it ain't never been, fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with a ten, nine, eight, seven, triple six, five, forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm, get out the way or get up torn
Ain't a picture big enough to fit what we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was, militant march of this war
Takyon, taking them down all we see is blood
Takyon, turning them out, how to trick out and freak that buzz

Oh shit I'm feeling it, takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it, takyon
All right that's tight, what it's like to experience, takyon

Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here's the deal, if you don't feel ill, don't want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get with that shit gets dial toned
Takyon, bitch slapping pussy clots and clones
Takyon, setting off Unabombs inside your dome
Give it up, bitch, you know this is it
Get with this or get left 'cause it's on, takyon (Takyon)

Cutty Rank:
Six, six, six million ways to die, choose
<|endoftext|>
Been working way too much need to get out and get fucked up
What's going on, where's it at
Make some calls to make it crack, let's see...
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside
The mission:
To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way

Be it acid on the tongue
Cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs
Like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more
So till dawn we're okay... but anyway...

Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime
That makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a good buzz going
'Cause everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And she's looking so you're knowing
You could get it tonight
But there's so much around
Best take your time do it right

As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all that's left of you
Is your most primal desires

Ass clappin', dick suckin'
Lock the door to the bathroom - quick fuckin'
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin', 'cause you're drunk and you'll be blackin' out
Before you even get a chance to think bout what you're doing

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch...
Bitch

Getting looser and looser and losing yourself
In the groove that has the whole party movin'
You're cruisin', you don't know what you're doing and you don't give a
'Cause you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding 'cause your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, it's time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, till it's finished come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks
Start to pondering rape
Me I'm all 'bout the face
But it takes all kinds
So pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song
You know the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate
Forget to hydrate
Till they're so fucked up they take
Off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill
Or between their hips
But either way I must say
I really don't give a shit
Long as it's done well, and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy
In the bowels of hell
Where every Lucy's hella horny
And their pussies don't smell

Argh... where's it at

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch...
Bitch

Responsibility's cool, but there's more things in life
Like getting your dick
Rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more 'cause you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well all right

It's time to find one and take one
Right now
It's time to find one and make one say
I'm down
Think I just found one, bout to break one off
Meanwhile...

Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles,
May have gotten too fucked up 'cause I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but it's worth a try

First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap
And I'll talk to you later
And when I do let's hope my story isn't all about haters

Where's it at, 'cause I want it like man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me 'cause I'm feeling that ass
Know what I mean?
Where's it at?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch...
Bitch
<|endoftext|>
He come to me with money in his hand
He offered me, I didn't ask him
I wasn't knocking someone's door down, I was running from that
When I got out, I was in that
I was already through that, I had that
I had the studio
I went to the studio
I went to Fox studios
I had it all, and I looked at it and said, "This is a bigger jail than I just got out of"
I don't want to take my time going to work
I got a motorcycle and a sleeping bag and ten or fifteen girls
What the hell I wanna go off into and go to work for?
Work for what, money? I got all the money in the world
I'm the king, man
I run the underworld, guy
I decide whos does what and where they do it at
What am I gonna run around and act like I'm some teenybopper somewhere for somebody else's money?
I make the money, man
I roll the nickels
The game is mine
I deal the cards

Beware

I close my eyes and seize it (Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it (Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it (Burn it)
I am the beast I worship

I close my eyes and seize it (Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it (Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it (Burn it)
I am the beast I worship

And I know soon come my time for in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow 'cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle, the triumphant overcome

Trips to where few have been out of thin ai, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends, have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow of the ebb and flow, where roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below the bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise from the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes, imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine to ride the waves of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament to why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect, dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath, exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness, channeled to invoke what we represent
Secret order, elitist horde of creeping fire seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour, eye on palm, time is gone
Moonlight drawn, fly till dawn, sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm of the coming storm in blood sworn
To glorify and for life adorn with all that dies to become unborn

I close my eyes and seize it (Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it (Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it (Burn it)
I am the beast I worship

I close my eyes and seize it (Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it (Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it (Burn it)
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship

In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry by hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by an older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse, the spiral storm of flames inside
The torch I raise, the force I ride
Feel my vessel go up in flames, flesh torch lit by thee unnamed
Direct connection to the source, vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch, wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few, shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades all that is and ever was
Inferno of witches blood, worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy, to pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak, bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitches leash, scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride, witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die, worship the flames with which I rise
Into apocalyptic skies

Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone in splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with naught to call my own but the path I walk alone
The hunger burns within my gut as my bones turn into dust

And I know soon come my time for in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow 'cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle, the triumphant overcome

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship

I am the beast I worship

What up?
Man uh see what's going on with it
In case you guys got to see about being hidden out here
They're gonna come to our smoke town
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, hyuh
<|endoftext|>
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine... yuh!

Sit in the dark and ponder how I'm fit to make the bottom
Fall through the floor and they all fall down, yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, yuh!
Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult
Killer cauldron smoke Stomp music seriously, yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Can't stop the groove licks jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected
To everything you want, ever did want, we got it why not come get it
Stick your head in that hole and watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence, yuh!
Yuh!

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine... yuh!

Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat, causes my jaws to call
Ah! Ah! Ah ah! Yuh!
The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that's ever been said, yuh!
Tie the chord kick the chair and you're dead, yuh!
Yuh!

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine... yuh!
Guillotine... yuh!

Head of a trick in a bucket, body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it, gotta burn it before it goes bad
One too many times been disgusted by the stench of rot is such a drag, yuh!
Get broke by the street like blood stained glass, yuh!
Choke on these nuts till the very last, yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Serial number, killing machine, the illest of means
To an end built on the filthy sound, you're experiencing, yuh!
Yuh!

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine... yuh!
Guillotine... yuh!

Tinted windows, bulletproof, the slip knot fixing rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel, the passion that blinds me so I feel, yuh!
Can't let go, no it flows through our veins
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down, yuh!

Yuh!

Yuh!

Yuh!

Yuh!

Yuh!

Yuh!

Yuh!

Yuh!

I fuck the music, I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Hit, hit, hit

Wanna beer, have no fear, comes and goes, man it's here
No one knows, feels so weird when it blows through my bones
I got a jones for it, I wanna know more 'cause it's 'bout what I got to show for it
I want some more of it, I want too much
I got so bored with it, I shot it up
Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up, yeah

What is it, where is it, how will it affect me?
Fuck that shit, I need that shits bound to be the death of me
Fuck buying it, I'm taking it and sharing it with nobody

'Cause all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blowjob

I own that shit, on some throwback shit, you already know that shit
You even know 'bout how I know the man who grows that, biatch
You can't buy it with your money, you can't find it overseas
It's one of those things that seems outlandish till you have, it's not a dream
As for me, I'm cool with it and that's all right 'cause it's my thing

What is it, where is it, how will it affect me?
Work that angle till it's beveled, curve of the blade doubled
Edge made to bleed the struggle, best believe the game's a hustle
Observer of the strange occurrences, conjurer of the subtle
Unseen but felt disturbances that burst a bitch's bubble
That's right it's all mine, it's all mine never was yours
Like how you wait in line while I walk straight through the door, straight through it
Hear you say something but ain't nothing, spectators ignored
Pay no mind to that chump's, just a player hatin' whore, yeah

I fuck the music, I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Ain't no fun if the aliens can't have none

How I fuck it dirty, how I make it twitch and scream
How it screams, "Oh baby hurt me, work me to the bone oh please"
How I bend the rhythm over and hit, hit, hit it on my knees
Give, give, give it up, I need it all the time
Bleed it on the drop of a dime, down to pound it till it shines
Moonlit lake of blood red wine, make no mistake, I makes it mine
Break shit down and make it grind to the groove used to align
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds through secrets behind and between every time I scream
"Shit is mine, it's all mine, all the time, shit is mine"

What is it, where is it, how will it affect me
Fuck that shit, I need that shit, yeah

Thought you knew, thought you thought, thought you did but did not
Come on through what you got, is it cool, is it hot?
Check one two, man don't stop, I'm not through black blood clot
In my view like that twat spread eagle cross the block

Spread eagle cross the block
Spread eagle cross the block
Spread eagle cross the block

Need no ego to rock, what we know just gets dropped, how we keep shit on lock
'Cause all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blowjob

Shit is mine, it's all mine, all the time, shit is mine

Ride and Arthur Brown:
Into the flame, into the fire
With no regard for a thing
Fuck that I'm the lord of the game
I rule this empire
(I am the God of hell fire)

Ride and Mexican Girl:
Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
'Cause no one has came even close to the train of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher
Than anything seen in your entire
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire
Electrified rain from the (Lips of the driver)
Whippin' the wheel, flippin' donuts to peel
Out on the face of the base, where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel it so much my gut burns like the tires
Movin' this movement of real shit inspired
By all that has come before this and was done for the real ones packin' real guns loaded with power
Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour
The weakness that runs when we come (Fuckin' cowards)

When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)

Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
'Cause no one has came even close to the train of thought
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Which we maintain like soldiers of fame
And fortune denied as to to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes
Death to everyone who does not recognize
Wars never done, think it is you die

Where was I now? Like I said before
Hear someone knockin' at my front door
Who could it be? Should I ignore
The knockin' or see what could be in store?
For me if I leave the safety of the shore
So many options, so little time
To do what I want 'fore the end of the line
Places its blade in the small of my spine
Is it paranoia? (Is it real?)
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel?
When they ask if you can make it and you don't wanna go

When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
Look, I'd rather be stuck naked (Hits so low)

Than waste my time like the last time and every time before that
Don't waste my time even one more time when you know that shit is whack
Don't make me remind of you of the last time you said you'd never go back
Fuck where you're from, fuck where you're goin', it's all about where you're at

Takyon
Tak, takyon (Takyon)
Takyon
Tak, tak

Triple six, five, forked tongue
Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones

Oh shit I'm feeling it, takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it, takyon
All right that's tight, what it's like to experience, takyon

Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like, "Fuck, what was that?"
Man I don't know, but it made me feel so heated how we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know 'cause even if you did, you'd keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat, we make beats catch
Beat it till it bleeds to death, each track, epileptic seize every head we crack
Like EPMD snapping necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map (Takyon)

Oh shit I'm feeling it, takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it, takyon
All right that's tight, what it's like to experience, takyon

Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale till the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird, try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't 'cause it's way too sheer, how to make a hater disappear
Take shit where it ain't never been, fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with a ten, nine, eight, seven, triple six, five, forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm, get out the way or get up torn
Ain't a picture big enough to fit what we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was, militant march of this war
Takyon, taking them down all we see is blood
Takyon, turning them out, how to trick out and freak that buzz

Oh shit I'm feeling it, takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it, takyon
All right that's tight, what it's like to experience, takyon

Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here's the deal, if you don't feel ill, don't want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get with that shit gets dial toned
Takyon, bitch slapping pussy clots and clones
Takyon, setting off Unabombs inside your dome
Give it up, bitch, you know this is it
Get with this or get left 'cause it's on, takyon (Takyon)

Six, six, six million ways to die, choose

What ya gonna do when they come for you?
A gang of hatin' pigs
What have they ever really done for you?
Ain't never done shit
Stash what you got 'cause they're comin' through
Best get rid of that quick
'Cause when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip

Minding my own business
Minding my own business
Minding my own business
Minding my own business

Try to hem me up like for life stuck in the klink, haters in blue
How they set me up? Should I test my luck?
Here they come, they're in pursuit
What did I do? What haven't I done? You want to see my ID? Umm
Well, ok, where I'm coming from? Just on my way, not on the run
What you want me to say? Are you just 'bout done?
Power trippin', asshole lickin' haters
Notice how they strut through the spot like anybody wants to see a cop
Man, everybody knows they suck, I got to be somewhere 'round fuck
Why the hell you always stoppin' me 'round the clockin' me, like what?

What ya gonna do when they come for you?
A gang of hatin' pigs
What have they ever really done for you?
Ain't never done shit
Stash what you got 'cause they're comin' through
Best get rid of that quick
'Cause when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip

Six feet deep below the street so they can't never say shit again
Fuck the man with a thick broomstick and put a black flag on the end
Got to watch my back or just like that, I'm bound to get locked up
The law's watching me constantly too close and way too much
Looking over my shoulder and checking in the rear view mirror
'Cause I'm never not but a moment from getting taken to jail
They're knocking at my door, down my door
They're shining lights in my eyes, exactly what do they stand for?
Ever asking more of I, man, why?
Like it matters why I chose to ignore all the laws I've been told to abide
Think I'm on parole, thinking I just stole some shit, you got an APB out on
But no, you're wrong as usual, hell no, it wasn't me
Have the nerve to ask me if I'm drunk when I'm pissing in the middle of the street

Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my

By the way why they always acting like they know how to size me up
Ignorant bastards coming after me all the time on mine, had enough
Why they always wanna hassle me, pigs all up on my nuts
Like they have to be, like I can't see 'em tryin' to play shade tree in the cuts
By robbing me of my dignity so in the end, I never say much
But ain't a time pass I don't wish I could flash on Penelope like fuck

Shot this for everyone who's been there for my real ones who understand
What it feels like to have your rights read to you by the

Klink klink klink klink
Klink klink klink klink

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Useless information occupies every open space inside your skull
You know what's going on every day, every night
Everywhere swear you're so international
Upside-down cross on the Jumbotron, wait up, hold on
Blowing anthrax off my palms, say what? You're wrong
Switch stance, face plant, napalm fire starters
Flatlander, plug puller, nosedive turbulence chartered
You speak in abbreviations because real life conversation moves too slow
You're the media's creation, yeah, your free will has been taken and you don't know
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Never seen without one hundred, she's a satanic priestess
Anarchy on ice freak flag flying faceless elitist
Crow on the down low end, reppin' Orion's belt
Atlantis ancient vagina getting dusty on the shelf
Enter the pigs don't get it, no hands I'm shattering jaws
Double nickles on the dime, fuck glam can lick my balls

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Whatcha gonna be when you're grown young blood? Gonna be a helpless drone
Won't ever have to think, no your head'll be linked directly to your cell phone
The virus is alive, I can see it in your eyes, the infection is full blown

Career killer, double decker packed with suicidal brides
Four armed fury in a filthy dream about splitting your bitches' thighs
Enters through unknowing eyes, touch the keys, it's in your mind
Can't delete it and soon you'll find how bad you need it all the time

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Shiva slashin' through your flat screen, is nowhere for you to hide
Strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide
My thoughts tie knots in silver spoons, vampire on the rise
Punk a chump with a cunt for brains platoon in the zone and on the grind
Dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks
Catch and release
Time released horse capsule swallowed to wake the savage beast
Keep up or get left behind

Culture shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Gotta get them outta here now
Infected, act so weird, how'd you get it? You're pathetic
Quarantine the virus, God law

Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
(If you're delusional, your call will be transferred to the mothership)

I'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you
Plutonium lore, what this is, what this for
Feel my fists push black holes through your bitch ass decor
Spit it back like a whore and make you shit your fucking drawers
Scared to ride, cowards fall before my eyes, sound of my balls
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons, drug by demons down your halls
Can't imagine what's fit to happen when I get to flashing, see the small
Shrink to a fraction of what their lacking and less than that in no time at all
Can't believe they have the gall to try and act
Like they're not trapped between these walls, bring it, bring it, kill it

Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, I said bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, I said bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it

Sometimes feel like I'm close but never get there, never get there
Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here? Wanna leave here
And if I am why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
And if I can, were they even ever there at all? Not at all
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad
Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand
But in the end I guess I just don't give a damn, twist a gram
And keep on sticking with the original plan, fuck it man
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged, even on the low
But I do know what you do not speak of, don't know but it shows
Try to hide but I see who you are because I just know
Keep talking but you already said too much, there you go
How it is now's how it always was, that's on my blood
How it is now's how it always was, that's on my blood

Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, I said bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, I said bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it

See my blood spill drip, by chances
Try to chill, quit, 'cause I can't just slip into azagthoth trance
Tongue hissing, serpent chants
Come again work it in, yeah just like that
We paint our insides black as the shadows 'hind our flesh
And make all that we lack, the part of life that we forget
All praise due to the fact that we've forgotten how to sweat it, check it, bring it, kill it
On everything I own, swear would rather slit my throat
And die on the run than be the one who ends up hangin' from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game before
I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame, all the way insane
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Trying not to let the feeling, tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing and it won't stop
Tell yourself it's almost over but it's not

Get it
Get it

Get it
Known for it
Get it
Get it
Known for it

Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it till I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was bout to crash
So I mashed through hit, known for it
Had to do it, hacked into it

I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it? Known for it

I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it? Known for it

Let them eat shit and die as I creep lit
Off the deep hits with a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon to freak this
Get it

You can tell me what you said, go ahead but no sooner than you said it
You can bet it was left for dead all you said in and out of my head in seconds
Keep 'em guessin endlessly, never let 'em know where you're headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How to show 'em they don't mean shit to me
Put 'em in their place 'cause they ought to be
Kept in the dark, no posted see never only so much of me
Double OG with a skeleton key
Never meant a thing to me, effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy, extremely selective memory
Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone or it'll take everything you own, floor it
Get it, get it

I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it? Known for it

I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it? Known for it

Known for it since way back, all about it, never been without it
How to ride it inside out of the clouded by the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost don't doubt it, you might just need it
Already did that can't never go back
Yeah fuck that, gets the bozack
Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done with that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don't trip
If ya have one, let a man so I could flip a bitch and kill it (Get it)
Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it to wind, round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed 'cause I will be damned if mine ever decays
Forever on attack, gut check the blind (Get it)
Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life
'Cause I am known for it

I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it? Known for it

Been working way too much need to get out and get fucked up
What's going on, where's it at?
Make some calls to make it crack, let's see
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside, the mission
To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way
Be it acid on the tongue, cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more so till dawn we're okay but anyway

Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime that makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a good buzz going
'Cause everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And she's looking so you're knowing you could get it tonight
But there's so much around
Best take your time do it right

As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all that's left of you is your most primal desires
Ass clappin', dick suckin, lock the door to the bathroom, quick fuckin'
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin' 'cause you're drunk and you'll be blackin' out
Before you even get a chance to think bout what you're doing

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch, beeotch, beeotch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?

Getting looser and looser and looser and losing yourself
In the groove that has the whole party movin'
You're cruisin, you don't know what you're doing
And you don't give up 'cause you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding 'cause your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, it's time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, till it's finished, come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks
Start to pondering rape, me, I'm all 'bout the face
But it takes all kinds so pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song, you know the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate, forget to hydrate
Till they're so fucked up they take off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill or between their hips
But either way, I must say I really don't give a shit
Long as it's done well and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy in the bowels of hell
Where every Lucy's hella horny and their pussies don't smell

Argh
Where's it at?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch, beeotch, beeotch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?

Responsibility's cool, but there's more things in life
Like getting your dick rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more 'cause you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright
It's time to find one and take one right now
It's time to find one and make one say, "I'm down"
Think I just found one, 'bout to break one off, meanwhile
Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles
May have gotten too fucked up 'cause I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but it's worth a try

First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap and I'll talk to you later
And when I do lets hope my story isn't all about haters
Where's it at, 'cause I want it like man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me 'cause I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?
Where's it at?

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch, beeotch, beeotch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch

I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?

Pass that shit

Hold on man, park the car
I have no idea where we are
Think we may have drove too far
Yeah, I can see they're right behind us
But there's nothing we can do
We can't get caught slipping get off that shit and just be cool
They're on to us but don't look now
They think they're 'bout to take us down
Fuck that I'm not going out
Pass that shit

At the next corner, turn left, it's time to handle this
Nowhere to go don't trip have no time for that pussy sh-agh
In a minute it'll all be finished what, you don't think I speak the truth?
You think I could just be sittin' here listenin' to Sonic Youth
Anywhere when they try to ride on you thinking I'm gone
I'll creep up on 'em from behind and break 'em off one by one
In the time it takes you to blink your eyes, shit'll already be done
But just in case anything goes wrong, keep your right hand on your

So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin' steady creepin', blood creepin'

Shake the bottle, what's it hold?
How many have I already sold
Hope not too much 'cause I feel insane, need more than one to numb the pain
Slithering through my brain
Thoughts stuck on that train
Off the track and up in flames
Fuck it I'll swallow these blue ones, yeah, and maybe this big one
And I might as well take a few more with me just in case I get some

I know you want 'em yeah no problem
Got that covered tramp I brought 'em
How it creeps up on me so slowly I don't notice my eyes rolling
To the back of my head and falling, shit somebody's calling
Can't answer the phone, call 'em back when I'm 'bout to leave
Can't think straight man I'm so fucking blown

So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine

To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin' steady creepin', blood creepin'

Down the alleys in the middle of the night
I'm trashed, so high it's hard to ride my bike
Might crash whenever I'm this fucked up
Drunken monkey through the cuts, who gives a fuck?

To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin' steady creepin', blood creepin'

Get get get get, got got got got
Blood rush to my head lit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot

Tailpipe draggin', volume blastin', bailin' out my brain
Red light flash, them stop I smash
Abraxas hydroplane, massive
Catch this flight flow, rainin' madness
Mastered mine and laced the ave
With black cat fish tailin' waves of stratus
Curb right to far left lane

Don't wait for me, if I care
'Bout anything, anywhere
Losin' myself, I get the stares
What I'm lookin' at, wasn't there
Wasn't there, wasn't there
Wasn't there, wasn't there

Nothin' out there, can't stay inside
Hit the bar, sleep deprived
Who drove the car? I'm still alive
Up in smoke, moon was low
How'd you know, didn't say I did
Whose is this, you know what this is
But do you know?

Get get get get, got got got got
Blood rush to my head lit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot

Fly inside out rot them big shot simp
Slot shit but a one hit quick stop

So many ways to skin the frame
Remember when first got strange
Now I just think it life obey
So what comes next
Right away, right away
Right away, right away

Raise the cup, tilt it dry
Come black cloud, cover the sky
Tongue through pupil of your eye
Sickness moves you can't deny
Lickin' through you, mastermind
For mercy man cry

Yeah, I'm knowin' and you know why
Nail through mental ever them try
Pigeon hole me get crucified
Can't clone this edge, what's it cost
To lose your head without end up lost
Should be askin', "Where's the safe?"
Born with a ski mask on my face

Get get get get, got got got got
Blood rush to my head lit hot lock
Poppin' off the fuckin' block knot
Clockin' wrist slit watch bent thought bot, uh yeah

Lycanthropic manic cycles
Fire water burnin' bibles
Wake up ragin', call a taxi
Take me to the nearest city
Cell light up yeah get at me
Make it quick though, blood, I'm busy
Get busy, get busy
Get busy, get busy

Drilled a hole into my head
Pierced the bone and felt the breeze
Lift my thoughts out, them sick bed
With a pair of crow skeleton wings
Know nothin' since then it seems
Been floatin' through the nexus threadin' dreams
But did you know? Yo

Get get get get, got got got got
Blood rush to my head lit hot lock

Anticipation grow slow
Deviated septum blow hole
Sugar cane ko ko
Aye, aye, pass the dro my way
Or no way twenty fo no 25-8
Thought you knew
Suicide lane
Fuck you
Grab my crotch, what's my name?
Been round the block
Hangin' scumbag slangin'
Pay dirt cave in
Takin' no prisoners
No escaping wash brain hook
Nothin' I'm sayin'
Aye, aye, know what I'm sayin'?

I got the diamonds, scrapin'
Sidin', wastin' my life
In altered states, dem
Back it up
I got the fever

Sprayin' execution, witch fingernails clawin' through dem
Crawlin through dem
Tunnels losing
Touch with everything I'm doin'
Aaarrrggghh... mass confusion
Can't make more electrocution
Half cocked full tilt
Rabid dog
Filth aarrrggghhh
Know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck it
Upside down in a
Soft top bucket
Screamin'
Shred it

I got the diamonds, scrapin'
Sidin', wastin' my life
In altered states, dem
Back it up

Let me off, screeching halt
Concussion blinding
Not my fault
Ankles tied to cinder blocks
Aye, aye
By any means necesserated
Blade cut me
Sewer drain grated
Bubonic plague
Spreaded faceless
Lurking in the deadest spaces
On your knees, black goat anus
Christo anti clan of shameless
Came ta whip those
Into shameless
Here we go, devastated
Here we go
Here we go

Diamonds scrapin' the marrow, out my core
Who's in the mirror?
Who's at the door?
Someone's there
Wasn't there before
Ceiling connected
To the chord
Pull it!
Pull that shit!
Pull that shit!

I got the diamonds, scrapin'
Sidin', wastin' my life
In altered states, dem
Back it up

I stay, get up
Beats 'bout waist deep
Swallowed by beats
I stay niche
I've seen footage

What's that? Can't tell
Handheld dream shot in Hell
Deep space ghetto streets
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
Mystery 'hind that death door
Juke step electrocute the floor
What's the science of flyin' that high?
Got a no-no goin', one time
Creeps up behind me over my shoulder
Turn around, try to see but it's nowhere
Noided, noided, static on my blindside

Satellite, handle that with a lead pipe
Who captures life, who takes what's left, who stay?
On that next, already know my gillicutti, like I told you
Don't touch me, what's up with it?
I stay noided, stimulation overload account for it
Desensitized by the mass amounts of shit (I've seen)
I've seen it, I've been it
Can't delete it, feels like jail (Noided)
Full moon in the klink shining, don't sleep, surveillance post my bail

Off his shoulders in slow-mo

Juke step with so much boy-rude looseness seem like no bones in his skin (Noided)

Ambulance hit and run over pedestrian in Brazil
Little tiger, boy soldier
Twist cap back and kill (Noided)

Double helix phoenix from beyond

Strapped to suicide missions set off with so much pride

No maps with directions
No answers, just questions
Second guessing everything you swore was so can't tell you what to do

Slap the beat till the floorboards crack
'Neath the weight of this lic, step back
Off in the rhythm like beta in the bong
Got to give 'em make 'em sway like palms
In the wind my lip blow, mic spray krylon
25/8 till the break of dawn

Guerilla bass, straight from the trenches
Posers impaled on picket fences
How to rest your head in roach infested basements
And smoke punk weight for breakfast
Chop shop lifted bump till the tape deck break
Ask Samo how he flipped that material girls pancakes as zydeco copper kettles
Liquor store, sellin' singles

Grab your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane while everybody's like, "No"

I got this pregnant snake, stay surrounded by long hairs
A plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs
Make your water break in the Apple Store
Sink or swim, who fucking cares
Cut the birth cords, press send
Yeah, thick, Gaga can't handle this shit
Headed for the Sammy Davis wing
Throw up a black hole at the entrance of Linens-n-Things on the way
Never call it a day
Visit Tesla's grave for the ninth time today
Still on the way, bigger wigs

When you come out, your shit is gone
When you come out, your shit is gone
When you come out, your shit is gone
When you come out, your shit is gone

I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I know the first three numbers, I'm in
I know the first three numbers, I'm in

I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I know the first three numbers, I'm in

When you come out, your shit is gone
When you come out, your shit is gone, I'm in
When you come out, your shit is gone
When you come out, your shit is gone

You'll catch a JPEG to the head, √ºber reach
You're an intern, I'm Wikileaks
Most loved, therefore most hated
Come and knock on the door, we've been waiting for you
Game changer, reclusive-aggressive
Yinging and yanging, noided
Info warrior, Jack the Hacker
The rolling stoner, puffin' on disaster
My existence is a momentary lapse of reason
Got the DNA of gothic lemons
Shred it thirteen times out of eleven
Your bad ideas are the ATM, shed my skin
Leave it for the homeless to sleep in
Prodigal, fuck that nautical
Teachin' bitches how to swim (I'm in)

I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I know the first three numbers, I'm in
I know the first three numbers, I'm in

I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I know the first three numbers, I'm in

Teachin' bitches how to swim
Teachin' bitches how to swim, I'm in
Teachin' bitches how to swim
Teachin' bitches how to swim

Now backstroke
Through your K-hole
Don't run, you might slip
The table's flipped, now we got all the coconuts, bitch

Burmese babies under each arm
Screaming beautiful songs
The cray-cray ultra-contrarian
Havin' conversations with your car alarm
When you come out, your shit is gone
Soon your crew will be serving sandwiches named after me
Vietnamese style, fool, please
Front row at the mass games, untracable by name
You speak of us in certain circles, you will be dethroned or detained

Gone
Gone
Your shit is gone
Gone
When you come out, your shit is gone

I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I know the first three numbers, I'm in

My stone wall, it's on dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi, okay okay feel me
I'm in an eight high abandoned building
No daylight, one midnight lamp lit 24/7
Murdered out windows two exits
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion so I'm surrounded
Geiger count it not goin' out shit's bout to get kamikaze
Fuck a nazi
When the world comes knocking
Fuck the world, fuck this body
Know it won't be long now
Feel my nerves wet my brow
Mood in my tomb, red moon heavy
Sling jaw shot out the window and yell
"Come up and get me"

I'm epiphanic amnesia
I'm in Jimmy Page's castle
I'm off the planet
Echo astral, vinyl lasso
The Sacto asshole
I'm not down for anything
Fuck around and say anything

My stone wall, it's on dog gaze duct taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi, okay okay feel me
I'm in an eight high abandoned building
No daylight one midnight lamp lit 24/7
Murdered out windows two exits
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion so I'm surrounded
Geiger count it not goin' out shits 'bout to get kamikaze
Ah, fuck a nazi

Come up and get me

My life as a fuck
Ain't one thing I don't hate
Tell me my times almost up
I will say, "I can't wait"
Put your gun to my head
I'll blow smoke in your face
Think you got what it takes
Come up and get me

Can't tell hell in my head
Thirteenth bell am I dead?
Or in asylum pill force fed
Lyin' to myself all by myself
Strapped down to my bed
Tongue cut out the mouth of reason
And chucked off the river's edge
Think fast, is it tear gas or fear masked
By figments of my fragmented mind?
Who's my enemy, them or me?
Step to me and you'll die
Grand delusions magnified
Fuck the truth, wastes my time
It's all good bet, what's that?
Footsteps on the stairs
Never could rest they're always there
Who are they? I don't care
I just know they're tryin' to X me
Give a fuck, come up and get me

Come up and get me

Skeletal bell toller
Handle in each of my tentacles

Live to feel life beat me nothing hurts
I'm seething your smoke signals proceed me

Where everyone but I can see me
Why are you here

My flint lit slit that attitude
Lil brain got confused
Choo choo train of thought in my logic loop

Fear over pride lil boy
Flood you can't hide lil boy
Face of a woman lil boy
Tears of a child ll boy

Broken hands on all my fingers
Buckle down my knuckles like screamers
Stitch up my blown out trench with leather streamers
I keepem hangin' from my balcony shrivel in my sun
Warm piss showin through his cheap slacks this bitch is done
Open my front ragin like I've never slept
Make him cry like a baby formula on the breath
Needle of your eye lil boy
River nile wide lil boy
Fear over pride lil boy
Flood you can't hide lil boy
Face of a woman lil boy
Tears of a child lil boy
In a foreign land lil boy
Single file lil boy
You know we burn through it burn through it
We ain't takin' turns to it turns to it

Why I set myself up in a raging sea of flames?

Exhale your will and forget I ever knew you, fuck do you do?
Fuck a man wit hips for hulu
Rack a snitch chalk and cue you
Corner pocket consume you
Too many hoes in my, too many hoes in my motherfuckin' meal
Asking if I know how a motherfucker feels
How a motherfucker feels
Slit them choke flip them boat, dead bitch float swollen corpse
No remorse, navigated off course
Of course I can make you scream but if you ask for more
Bullshit matador grab the floor whip it cracked to all fours
You whimper while I check my phone

Down a spiral staircase winding to Hell

Fuck it now, I can't quit will never be the same
I got that attitude you got no thang
I'm fit to hurt you gives a fuck about the way I move weight
Dark matter flu state of consciousness
Blew straight through you won't do shit but beg me to do this
Again and again and again and again
Strangler clutch sine wave deconstruct my way or no way bangin'
Hey makin' lust, lucid nut shake shake it up, booyaka
You're a bitch made to be crushed
Came like what now you crave my touch
Flat busted on front street cake cuppin'
Say you wasn't lion mane

Head hunter fuck the fame, switch lanin' ripper slangin'
Hit me nuclear wind at my back
Smokin' goldfish at the photo mat

Feel me now

My forefinger flippin' pentagrams
Left hand cast them pix by them peak facin' south
Pinhole pic of my wingspan jail breakin' doubt
Highest vibration ninth ring of fire crowned
War cry, feel my call
Hear my chamber revolve in your brain like the halls of Amenti
Treat a bitch like a whore
Leave your pink sock at the door
Saturn level flexed
Like these fractals, I coalesce
I'm not takin' this shit anymore
One way in come again
One way in no way out
Cheek in tongue when in doubt, feel me now
Violators feed 'em vapors
Don't do me no favors

Feel me now

Drop top changa
I flow, go boom boom off my rockers
Rollin' doom bumbata choppers
See me through spotlight cherry
Fog like nun head, no teeth mary
Don't carry on
Don't where are we how far along
Me care not dare not key my brom
My life on a limb about to break
I'm a tower 'pon tectonic plate

Feel me now
Feel me now

Why you think I'm havin' everything?
You're rimmin' ass for ask 'em
Whose ass they're rimmin when I'm flaggin'
Load your cannon shutter flash heavy damage
Steady hand shit, forget me you can't bitch
Slappin click clack tricks stretch please
My sleeves plastic can't breath in this atmos
Fuck atlas, my ego palms planets
Fuck you yeah yeah it's that fuck you can't stand slip
Cut you 'cause I can dip

Feel me now

I'm the man who press that button
Sweaty palm get caught bluffin'
Fold a man into nothin' for nothin'
My oxidized gold shaft floods your jugular with Lucifer
I'll shoot it word feel like you swallowed Jupiter
Today your city, tomorrow lifting the universe
One way in, come again
One way in, no way out
Cheek in tongue when in doubt
Feel me now

Under pressure I

My backbone slip left to the death
Massive procession of cold sweat
Stalactite step slide through you're next
Get me inside, I'll do the rest

Master of self contained combust
Sustained disgust, command him claim
Figure eight strut, can't be touched
Subversive infiltration reign supreme, in none me trust
Why must them? Fuck them
Mine vomit stain them, feel not but hate them
Line up back, facin' suspense rapes them
One by one, hot cumshot clip spray them
Life drop and waste them in pine box laid them to
Grime dismantled, churn the fat
Light the candle, burn the wax
Before me dies in scorch uprise
Can't deny it no way back

Warped rotation, path is blurred, memento mori, dead man's curve

Oblivion transcender becomes him shroud
I can't remember, I'm no one now
Comin' for yours, lock your doors
Identifier destroyer

Come on, stick me, cut me, drain me
Suck me, drink me, take me down
Feel me, one three, make your pumping
Chamber pound and drown

Push me harder push me push me swang into tomorrow

Gawk as I thread this Loch Ness slipstream sepsis
Subconscious up f twitch asterisk see off my meds glitch
Thoughts squealin' through my mildew watch my back or I'll kill you
Schizo superscript scan the voice imprint only I can hear you
Deserted mansion in my head half-lidded lanterns returnin'
Sclera scarlet as wall of virgin bombed by flask of bourbon
Can't be certain
Your intercom I'm fingering you don't wanna but you buzz me in

My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder push me push me swang into tomorrow

Nathan perculatin' proper
Caiman propellers comin' off she's hella copter
My neck bone sprayin' guava
Shimmy snakin' status caved in mental state been shanked and soldered
I got the nasty in my taxi you need a lift
You can sit between the backseat and my dick
If the law catch me in the act and I happen ta die today
Push one my swing out in a glass of purple rain
Candy painted by the lord of stainless steel liquid your ashy brain

My moods live on that swing same
Push me harder push push me swang into tomorrow

I got that feeling zero feeling
Can't stop stealing zeros killing all your millions
Somebody kill me somebody killed me

People are tryna hear what I'm saying

Both ends of my candle counting paces
Never stop chasing each others faces
I'm the mask that separates them
Bridge their sole desires cravin'
Don't make me take my face off
Show you why I hate soft
Let flock of sheep get shaved off
Lynched from their halos

Call me crazy, but I swear my line's been tapped
In my glasshouse, prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
Omega megalomaniac
In my glasshouse, prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back

I'm the coat hanger in your man's vagina
Manic downstroke on fire
Beat it, bitch, all black, can't fade it
Beat it, bitch, I came to brang it
Fuck bourgeois, ODB raw
Your pearl white teeth, my Yellowman jaw
Say only what you think I know you should
Hate myself more than you ever could

Call me crazy, but I swear my line's been tapped
In my glasshouse, prepared for surprise attack
Realized I held the blade inside my back
Omega megalomaniac

Trend setter maximum third planet from the sun orbit my lungs
Bulldozin' cul de sacs ground under over every act
Cut no slack no slack

No chance to throw I rush the mound
Rage stormin' off the chains remind me of rape house slave cock rings
You're played out like talking
Your cadence is sloppy
Can't break me I got me
You're grave stink I'm lofty

Artificial death in the west, east, pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck, breathe, she shoot pussy through your chest, you die
There was a artificial death in the west, east, all pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck breathe, G-O-D, she shoot pussy through your chest, you die

Where you runnin' now?
Where you runnin' now? Where you runnin' now?

Where you runnin' now?
Where you runnin' now? Where you runnin' now?

I'm barely there, I'm everywhere
Heavy thin air, Sahara mascara
Smeared, end of an era
Tracks on Hera's peacock thighs
China white skies, ivory of my leper eyes
Tone of sighs off nylon lips (Where you runnin' now?)
In fishnet wet guise of gimp horizon
Slit bled like my wrist, I suck it dry, like from the tit
Which nipple's mine? Read the signs, still can't decide
At your own risk, at your own risk
Don't touch me bitch, don't touch me, bitch (Where you runnin' now?)
Accustomed to these satin glitches, drippin' from my casket's innards
Charmer play me out the basket, last image I saw was splintered
My reflection, I wasn't in it, in slow motion, I give in
(Where you runnin' now? Where you runnin' now?)
Hopeless premonitions, tomorrow didn't come, some say it's hiding, but they're the ones who've hidden
Euphoria followed by visions of peasants eating pigeons
(Where you runnin' now? Where you runnin' now?)

There was a artificial death in the west, east, all pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck breathe, G-O-D, she shoot pussy through your chest, you die
There was a artificial death in the west, east, all pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck breathe, G-O-D, she shoot pussy through your chest, you die

Where you runnin' now? Where you runnin' now?
Where you runnin' now? Where you runnin' now?

Watching me, watching me, watch them watch me
Watching me, watching me, watch them watch me
Watching me, watching me, watch them watch me
Watching me, watching me, watch them watch me (Where you runnin' now)

Hole in this platinum ship of fools, nomadic rule, concept, no rules
Mobile shrine of this destitute wasteland mute
Screamin' at me, winkin' at me, like I love it
Fucking with me, fuck it

My star gate in a vacuum monitors our view
This valley is an urn, this valley I'm wadin' through
(Where you runnin' now?
Where you runnin' now?)

Feel like I'm chasing after me
Feel like dead weight in a sea of Vaseline, all that can't be seen
Watching me watching me watch them watch me
Try not to dwell on my cell, my empty shell shedding me (Where you runnin' now?)
Artificial death in the west, east, pyramids on deck, shine (Where you runnin' now?)
No matter where I turn, shut down, shut down
Everyone's a runaway (Where you runnin' now?)

There was a artificial death in the west, east, all pyramids on deck shine
Wet hair on her neck breathe, G-O-D, she shoot pussy through your chest, you die

Get so fuckin' dark in here
Come, come, fuck apart in here
I die in the process, you die in the process
Kettle drum roll, hard shit
Fuck, I said fucker don't start shit

Come, come, fuck apart in here, I

Come, come, fuck apart in here, I

I hover above you, life pulled out your mouth
I become you, opening of the mouth
Unlawful possession, jellyfish in cold sweat deep end
Hollow shell twitch disconnection
Pupils swell, my entrance
Hijacked no questions asked
Stretch you on like latex mask
My sigils your epitaph

Come, come, fuck apart in here, I

Come, come, fuck apart in here, I die

I'm not you, I'm not you, I'm not you
Fear, you wear it well mademoiselle
Here's to your destiny, hysterics scream help
Don't worry in a few, you'll all be somewhere else
Prepare yourselves, freelance motherfucker

Get so fuckin' dark in here
Come come fuck apart in here
I die in the process, you die in the process
Kettle drum roll hard shit
Fuck I said fucker don't start shit
Emerald tablet apartment toxic
Come, come, fuck apart in here, I

Come, come, fuck apart in here, I

Twenty minutes, I'm almost there
Enter high tide, blank stare, ripples rise
Count 'em frame by frame
Edge of shore hogtied
Can't wait to fuck my brain

Rip current pulls me down by open wounds on my lower legs

Delusional tendencies I'm belly up
Fuck it though I indulge in supremacy
Sixty beggars behind my casket coma
Sub under gaze of sadistic dom'
Suck the skin off my teeth
Automaton embalmed
Under breath whisper never go too far

Single strike cadence slip
Once I'll make you my bitch
We don't want we take shit
Hella zeros life elixir drenched
All I need is my fix
Fuck your idols suck my dick

I'm on my way out
Pressin' down the pillow till I can't hear you breathin'
For no reason
Five rings on my hand

Faces gag
Where the fuck's my true ones at
Wavin' high burnin' freak fuck flags
Takes one to no one knows how fucked I am
If I showed 'em they'd just run like hoes
Fuck these pussies on hella zeros
Two heavens is all I know

That's my fact, snatch it only as directed
Snatch it 'cause I got the queen's tits
Up my sleeves, snatch it like you're the queen's bitch
Up my sleeves, I hold your ground with my perch

Up my sleeves, I don't wanna cut my nap

I'm whirling, oh, my agony's priceless
I'll take my life any way you can slice it
Snatch my shaman fetish
Diner in the desert for effect, for effects
Snatch my shaman like connect

Pickled, punked, lavish (I've always known, I've always known)
If you miss it, I'll track it
My fetish like magic (Don't but when I do, I'll tell you how I knew)
Feel contrived instant you snatch it (I've always known, I've always known)

Snatch my, snatch my fetish

Snatch my, snatch my fetish

Also, also, also Mr. Whippy told me

My dead mother in my dream
Remember when December blew her ashes 'cross my jeans, off these jeans
Some things only I have seen
Some people only I have been
Used to know who I was
Fuck if I knew who that was
Pay no mind illogical
Just don't die in a hospital
Oh yeah, I should be worried
Oh yeah, I'm temporary

Don't but when I do, I'll tell you how I knew
I've always known, I've always known

I was conceived by my disease (I've always known, I've always known)
Up my sleeves
Anyhow, anymore (Don't but when I do, I'll tell you how I knew)
Anyone, anything (I've always known, I've always known)

Alchemy for your bodily up my sleeves
Nonsensically up my sleeves
Got a pendleton on my valley, up my sleeves

I'm so black quarterback throw off this app by his badge
Blare my organ for juice spike blonde kinks on my boots
Approach me licking his fur whining "I demand a word"
Swine must be the all the way hatched hell yolk raining down his chest
Clucking so fucking hard glance heartbeat through his vest
So I'm like, "Go ahead, blood" but my mind's on my wrist
Five minutes pass I'm a have to make you my piss
Gimp just kept shaking so I had to braid him like this
Comfort over freedom, pave a path of leisure have it all
Freedom over comfort, give you back so much leisure
Feel small
Xeroxed man dressed in gauze spider silk and menopause
Mustache showered with applause squished out packets like taco sauce
Gather crowd laugh it off Mr. Zogged by your boss

I'm so black quarterback, air it out, albino Black quarterback in all black he's so white, no I'm so
Black quarterback in all black, albino

Heady baby, Eddie's crazy

Autobahning Wonder Stevie

Dangling out the
Waning in the
Kicked under the
Vague it on the
Me versus the
Losing to the
Cackling like the
Crackling through the

Inanimate sensation
Vantage perspective from objective it came from
Inanimate situation
No relation close liaison
No conversation, no social contagion
Bother me, wanna be comrade intrusive
I remain inanimate aloof skip
Counterfeit like no can do bitch
My vinyl vibrate higher than you, bitch
I represent, ain't meant to pursue which
One of you, oh you all wanna ride, well I ain't got room stress
While we continue to make shit tight the loosest, ah

Blown out base
Blown out base

You got a minute? You're in my way
What's wrong? Wrong with who
So what's going on? Okay
Where you at right now? I'm not with you
Inanimate persuasion
Strictly still life with all of my occasion
Inanimate surge of inspiration
Glow like thermonuclear invasion
Compared to swapping thoughts regurgitation
I revel in lack of slightest acquaintance
No rancid level after taste inanimate negate opinion
As it unravel like enigmatic onion
Layers of interdimensional dominion

Blown out base (Yeah bitch
(Bitch, bitch)

My smoke, my butane
My boots, my headphones, my medicated noose
My deadroom, my schwartzwald hat, my Mac
My macaque skull, my lysergic stash
Empty streets at night, my bike
Apartment sink filled with dry ice
Condemned tenement, brandished rail spike
Disturb in flat noir and stale white
Gray cloud curled around my bearded compound like boa
One of two thunderbolt we ain't broke on tour
Concr√®te antique trapdoor twenty-four
Spots to get that get right
When I gotta get right some more
Type of get right I can't afford
I covet these things more than any living
I've never been

Blown out base

I'm so, I'm so
I'm so Northern California, I call scratch, "Bammer"
Pure overhander, live show on a banner
Axl Rose in a blender, Slash on Satan's fender
Rick James on the cover running through your lover
Like mean Mr. Mustard, stadium style
For those who came to jock
Watch that man salute you
Endless nameless Lady Godivas we snoop to
Like eighty-three mermaids in Brooklyn Zoo
Inanimate ghetto box we used to pimp through

Blown out base

Inanimate fixation
Obsessed with my demo tape collection
Inanimate riffs I'm glazin'
Brag you're making music, naw, you're makin' bacon
Skinhead, skinhead inna Dublin
I like my iPod more than fuckin'

I'm smoking cigarettes in the shower, when they get wet I just light another
Fatal cardiac over cancer, don't gimme no suffer
Steal me over feel me linger until I'm six under
Ain't a fucking thing sacred when I get naked

I'm lighting up like Vegas
All sevens king of pentacles
I'm chaining like it's money, dirty money surgeons general
As if my flesh keeps me prisoner, as if
I've been spinning chambers since the day I was born
Like what's it all for, like why the fuck not?
Fuck if I don't get off, I don't know how to be caught

I get off at all costs
I'm turned off
Pah pow, pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow, pah pow

I'm turned off, won't be back soon
Look up, see my nuts slap the moon
I'm turned off like a myth
Can't look me up, I don't exist
I spin the chamber 'tween my lips
I pull the trigger like a giff
I can't get hit, I've never lost
I'm a rumor, I'm turned off

My footprint precedes me, follow me
I'm all the way over my species
My footprint so dropped it's bottomless
Species call my redwings apocalypse
You want this bitch I drop a bitch
Snuff your bloodclot metropolis
Trail of anonymous casualties
Pah, pow, boom mastery
I've been over that glass house
All my windows blacked out
Straight jacked up the fuck up
Guts up, man down, my man, stand down
I'm not with it, I drop liquid
Red light district, can't be finished
You never started, you run for martyr
While I'd push harsher, lose it more further
Lose it more nerder, hahahahaha

Boom boom, boom boom
Boom boom, boom boom
Boom boom, boom boom
Boom boom, boom boom

I get off at all costs
I'm turned off
Pah pow, pah pow
I'll fuck you off at no cost
You're turned off
Pah pow, pah pow

Take off my shirt 'cause it hurt form of murder
Art of indifference trump consequences
Like first off, I'm turned off
Pah pow, pah pow

Trust me, you can't trust me, try trust me, you'll see why
When I see you through the ringer my ringer catch deuce deuce
I repeat like pi my ringer catch deuce deuce divided seven times
I'll lead you to where am I

I get off at all costs
I'm turned off
Pah pow, pah pow

You're turned off

Ain't fucker tame me yet
Fit to try and tame me, be my guest
Just try and game me, bitch
Try and tame me, I'm like, "So, anyway"
Try and game me, I'm like, "No, not today"
This bitch, bitch try and tame me, I'll make you mine

Why a bitch gotta lie?
Why a bitch gotta lie?
Why a bitch gotta lie?
Why a bitch gotta lie? Why a bitch gotta lie?
Why a bitch gotta lie? Why a bitch gotta lie?
Why a bitch gotta lie? Why a bitch gotta lie?
Why a bitch gotta lie?

Try and tame, if you're so sure
Ain't dead or alive, ain't wore this floor
My floor tremble, your voice, silencer, I make your choice
I make no excuses, just fucking noise
Try and tame me, maybe not up to you because
Can't tame me I'm proof of, fuck you gonna do, scream?
<|endoftext|>
I saw you doing peace signs with the FBI
Might've tried that in the future before so don't lie
All dead dogs go to heaven 'cause dumb bitches let them in
They're just racist and they wanna fuck
God chills out 'cause she doesn't touch
This is where I don't come in
This is where I have been maybe
Have a sad cum, baby

I fuck it out and I dip, dip, dip
Drop you like asses and you trip, trip, trip
I can't stop it when I drip, drip, drip
You can't stop it when you drip, drip, drip
I piss on your face like I'm piss piss piss
You lick up the place like you're piss piss piss
We pick up the pace like we're piss piss piss
I'm the fuck you're chasing like piss piss, piss piss, piss piss

My shit's been retarded since beginning of time
I'm up in your party like sickest one line
I'm the only thing ever on my mind
You're one of those things I never rewind
I'm coming out your pocket like carving pools
With my jewels, I'm throwing heebie jeebies
Like iTunes, the cars that go boom
These are my gold bars melted on spoons
My junk hits like martial law, you nod like true

I fuck it out and I dip, dip, dip
Drop you like asses and you trip, trip, trip
I can't stop it when I drip, drip, drip
You can't stop it when you drip, drip, drip
I piss on your face like I'm piss piss piss
You lick up the place like you're piss piss piss
We pick up the pace like we're piss piss piss
I'm the fuck you're chasing like piss piss, piss piss, piss piss

If I were her and she was him we would go and fuck ourselves again and again
Life is very dangerous and it wants to rearrange us like your friends, like the end
Show me into Target and I'll show you how I bought it with my mind in my mind
Touch it out in the parking lot, fuck me while the whole world watch us waste our time

I fuck it out and I dip, dip, dip
Drop you like asses and you trip, trip, trip
I can't stop it when I drip, drip, drip
You can't stop it when you drip, drip, drip
I piss on your face like I'm piss piss piss
You lick up the place like you're piss piss piss
We pick up the pace like we're piss piss piss
I'm the fuck you're chasing like piss piss, piss piss, piss piss

I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
I'm what the fuck happens
And I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
I'm what the fuck happens
And I can't know what I'm 'bout to do

I've got the powers that be, running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but

I'm what the fuck happens, when shit happens
When a fuck gives under no circumstances
Off your clock shit, memory persist a clock shit
Lick lick, a shot shit's cracking
I'm when shit happens
'Cause I'm not acting, like it, like it or not
I'm on that shit you're not, I'm this ceremony
I gouge you till you're fire as my testimony
To the powers that be, powers that be

I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
When I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
I'm what the fuck happened
And I can't know what I'm 'bout to do
Until it's too late for you
To steal my name, bow down on cue

I've got the powers that be running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but

The powers that be are running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but

I got on my shit kickers
Smoke coming out my fingers again
Can't fuck with the physical world
'Cause I comply with the powers that be
I'm never over right now
My stretchers rollin', I'm in the White House
The black lighthouse, I'm above this life now
I'm above the life now, I'm beneath me
Raised on short notice by the powers that be, powers that be

Hook me, catch me, squeal me in
Gut me, hack me, crop your grin
Pack me, sell me, claim we're friends
See me on the street, drop your grin
Squint your beady eyes and flinch
Like a sniveling shiesty snitch
Don't fret, I know you're just a bitch
I get paid by the universe
Morbidly blas√© when I'm not on display
Turn up my mic, your hair turn white
I get paid by the universe, I'm on salary
You get no fucks from me, I run the company
On the powers that be, I get paid by the universe

I've got the powers that be running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but

The powers that be are running through me
My favorite color is oh my god bitch
I'm wearing black gloves through your mall, I'm rich
You wanna check my pockets but

No, I ain't shit and I like that
You want a statement, I'm like, "Why's that?"
Your parasites showing, that's not my bad
Your bad's pathetic, your bad's your price tag
Your bad's embedded in your lives a white flag
A sterilized white flag born bred and buried in it
Wears you like a cherry finish, keeps you valuable and shiny
You're a shiny clown to me and the powers that be
<|endoftext|>
Canopy of corpse tree, branches loom above me
Vacuum of crushing, doom lies before me
My future dies behind me, my entry aborts me
I lean back and drill me, like on me I'm feeding
I'm starving, I hardly ever feel like being

Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
'Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive, beyond alive
Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
'Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive, beyond alive

Fuck I have's, all I need
Fuck I can's, all I bleed
Fuck I am, ever will be
I rise, I fall, I roll again
I have no age, I don't pretend I'm here
My absence stains me sketch gets weird
I thrive on empty

Can't predict me with them petty such a pity
My peak keeps rising, they keep sinking
Into lakes they're crying, I keep spitting
Wish I could see them dying, but my peaks too fucking misty
Tilt your lump, till back of your brains 'tween your weak slumped shoulder blades
Still can't scope peak I pave into one way street to space
Grovel in gravel at my base, while saddle control you seek
This world of cattle at my feet, born to get put back to sleep
At my feet, born to get put back to sleep

Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
'Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive, beyond alive
Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
'Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive, beyond alive

I roll like I don't know no better
I roll like bitch you know better
You have my utmost disrespect
I'm high as fucked up get

I crash on bed of nails in my frail
Suit of scabs I relax
While having seizures in my shack
I take no breather, I took the pact
I grind this stone into my path
I wait for you in this disguise
Remorselessly beyond alive
Beyond alive

Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
'Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive, beyond alive
Frightened people, you know who you are
Cowards, we know what you are
Play your fucking part, I'll bleed my fucking heart dry
'Cause I feel so alive, beyond alive, beyond alive

My life as a face without eyes, look away
Look away, look away, look away
No reply I'm beyond alive
My life as a face without eyes, look away
Look away, look away, look away
No reply I'm beyond alive
My life as a face without eyes, look away
Look away, look away, look away
No reply I'm beyond alive
My life as a face without eyes, look away
Look away, look away, look away
No reply I'm beyond alive

Fuck the sun, fuck white wine
Daylight sucks, waste of mine
I fuck my mind, narrow my mind
I bide my time like fuck in place
One day, I'll wave sun to ice
Watch its kind get thrown like rice
My cackle stretch out like thunder
So fucking loud, it's vulgar

I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold
These days I recede, rapid I reload
Gun my chances closed road, no road left to travel

I know what this calls for, where's my scalpel? Operation cut
Like I'm bored, sew my inner war up like corn rows
My internal war blows like freezing fog in Oslo, frozen
I can't get soft, baptized in hoar frost
Like carbon monoxide garage, freeze your blink with sandman's flush
I hate you so much, I hate your laws
I hate your need a cause, I hate your faux touch
I hate every last one of you, I ponder digesting razors
Just to be done with you, I love you so much

I'm triple the motherfucker
Mondo fisted, full of backwards
From bananatown manor
My slang step like legless lizard
I fuck around, fashion a rocket
Shoot to Mercury, for the winter
Extended vacation till I decompose on my splinters

I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold
These days I recede, rapid I reload
Gun my chances closed road, no road left to

Centuries of damn
I've never been so yawn
Can't believe I'm still standing
Can't believe life take this long
I stagger off to find my lighter
I don't return until the day Sag A* validates mankind's destiny in a worm

By the way, I don't pet bleachers
Court side to nose bleeders
Like I shoot shit with gimps
No response, lose 'em once
Incoming second attempt
To be real, I just shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em
Them clueless strut nailed to crucifix
Lilith shoved up her cunt, shoved up her cunt

Fuck

I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold
These days I recede, rapid I reload
Gun my chances closed road, no road
I pull my face out the dirt slow
These days I only wake up third of the way, narco
Held to deep rapid eye move, hold
These days I recede, rapid I reload
Gun my chances closed road, no road left to travel

I'm fucking tired of all the perks
I've tried nothing, everything works
For less I'm worth, I've served my bid
All fuck life wasn't what it is
All fuck life was just a bridge
I seen some free landed some tricks
Far I see high time man quit
Won't let you know when I get goin'
Phone ring too long

Phone ring too long, I'm probably gone
Ring tone jingle my swan song
I'll show you how to leave well enough alone
I'm not this world this on cue world
I fall back, concoct new worlds
I fall out in throbbing swirls
I fall until I stop this world
I fall the fuck off this world

I live down the street from you've noticed me, I've never seen you
Wonder what the fuck I do
Listen up, you nosy bitch, listen close
My most recent purchase, old black rope
Gonna learn how to tie it, hang it in my chamber
Perfect reminder, occult I'm made of
Come try it out whenever you wanna
Last night, 3:30 in the morning, Death on my front porch
Can feel him itching to take me with him, hail death, fuck you waiting for?
Like a question no one mention, he turns around, hands me his weapon
He slurs, "Use at your discretion, it's been a pleasure, Stefan"

Head on like dead, on like grey
Death in your way, not in my way, I got my way
I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way
I'm on one like bae, you're on your way
Way, way, way
Head on like dead, on like grey
Death in your way, not in my way, I got my way
I was in my way, crept out my way, kept out my way
I'm on one like bae, you're on your way
Way, way, way

I'm fucking tired of all the perks
I've tried nothing, everything works
For less I'm worth, I've served my bid
All fuck life wasn't what it is
All fuck life was just a bridge
I seen some free landed some tricks
Far I see high time man quit
Won't let you know when I get goin'
Phone ring too long

Don't you worry, impossible for anything to be a big deal
I'm in no weary, my vital post dated but clearly been ages since life had appeal
Far more than fascination, my second nature chant kill 'cause I can
This body by my own hands, my friends and family won't understand
So I stay in the end, don't make none to me
If wasn't for them, I'd make that decision on GP
Had to do it all again, I'd make that decision on GP

All the nights I don't die for you
Wouldn't believe how many nights I ain't died for you on GP
Not that I care, I'd be a liar if I sat here claiming I'd exit in a minute
But I can't say I wouldn't I have my limits
All the nights I don't die for you
Wouldn't believe how many nights I ain't died for you on GP
Not that I care, I'd be a liar if I sat here claiming I'd exit in a minute
But I can't say I wouldn't I have my limits

I keep, I keep
Good ideas
I keep, I keep giving bad
Giving bad people...

Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

Those who can't adjust
Ten fold dismantled pus
Operandi minus modus
My phlegm you to dust
Dragon chaser
I'll quit later
Asteroid to midnight powder
This like genocide just louder
Fuck who we going after
Fuck them, I'm a have to fuck them over
And the closer, shows over
Bet bitch much, you wanna bet, bitch?
Keep that o and x shit
Feed a narc my driveway
Don't trip 'cause I may

Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

I cough up locks, catatonic jingle
Mausoleum treatment, strands of chemo
Unwell out my slit gashes tempo
I'm crawling with swarming crescendo
Execution, my nerves I'm slurring
You deserve this, your worthless disturbs me

I want you to next time
It doesn't sound so bad when I say it in my mind
I want you to next time
It doesn't sound so bad when I say it in my mind

Mutter, stagger, I'm in you
I got you covered, scatter, you're meant to
Pull a lick real quick
Made off I fling
Shallow plots for senile kings
Cruelty keeps me even
I moan like flukes
Euphoria follows puke
I won't pull my chute

Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

Lead heavy lead us, remedy us
Hem me, I suffer to catch reflux
I ingest reflux
Bile threshold, cortex deluxe
Torture me lust
Holding horses with bacteria, uh
I'm downing this vial of old Siberia
Overtoning mysteria

I want you to next time
It doesn't sound so bad when I say it in my mind
I want you to next time
It doesn't sound so bad when I say it in my mind

Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

Good ideas

Headless
I skid like Rita lifted ocean
I drift like my planet don't spin
I skid all over marks like I'm haunted
Rev it up, twirl my la la like profits
It's never much, I'm war torn in the cockpit
Don't interrupt, my turbulence slaps
My path massive demands panoramic
Massive
Shitty, you're ten thousand leagues subzero sweat dripping
My Hancock do-rag riptides like tent city
Standoff through low lands eerie silencing

Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

Peel out, press me to magnetic slab
Severe swerving I tow lag
Off uncertainty till your zipper locks
My salvia silhouette commence shots
Sixty shots a second on this hexed clock
I strike 'tween each time your solar plex drops

Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

I'm skidding out I can't help yourself
I skid in doubt I've dealt with yourself
I tricked hell out
I'm all helter skelter, I'm on that Faust
None of me left but reflex skidding out
Pulse in my chest feel like it's fixing to bounce
Bounce, bitch, I can't be the road
I'm crashing into planes, I crash and stroll
Maxed out my oath
Don't blame me, I've no soul

Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

My skids till the brink, I jizz snowmen
Tall knives in my grill feel potent
My jigsaw manipulates you open
My skids rit rubbernecks agent orange
I skid like I'm no use
My headband expand like I choose juice
I binge, all black enhance my tragic
Ends to a means I can't establish
Noise of nomads on sapphire spice
Cumulus in both hands, can't kill myself twice
Pawns tremble like dildos wielded by duppies
Traumatized on for size, roadkill hides like yuppies
I'm too passcode, these gates won't stay closed
Control gets old, I smash out my skin
My vessel thrown like slack at the wind
I'm finally astral now, grab my stems

Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes
Spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes, spikes

Falling out in tune out my grooves, uh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

Influence executed
Mass execution, rapid improvements
Toothless accent, drawl of a shaman
Putrid fanatic ride out like famine
Luminescent rattles, thunder in vials
Choose your battles or end in piles
Braided fumigation, destitution ramped
Desiccated satyr make a massacre dance

Falling out in tune out my grooves, uh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

Psychotropic steel trap, rock a beat up bears hat
Naw man, I don't feel this and I shit on your guilt trip
Then extinguish your illness like seven grams of thorazine
Tyrannic authority cleansed by your aggressor
Inhuman elitist decline your surrender
Sign of the freak thriving on a bender
Forbidden discipline, all lines disconnected
Vacated premises occupied by my death wish

Falling out in tune out my grooves, uh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

Luster of entrails stacked and slung
Under cement veils my traffic hums
Compulsion on risers, your stranglers knuckles
Your temples buckle
Decompression silo inside this muzzle
Overdriven rituals on my torso, my infernal boro
If I went soft Glock to my navel
Flaws get knocked off, flaws get knocked off

Falling out in tune out my grooves, uh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping
Falling out in tune out my grooves, uh, warping
All I do is lose my form, I'm warping

Posse up steadily feel your void split, I'm like...

Why fuss don't be a medical procedure
Just stamp my fucking visa
I'm way too loose like

Code swallow dick, go get your boss
Security turn green 'cause I never floss
Fuck everything or I up the cost

Petty formula never amuses me

Poker fucking polygraphs

This side of my machete
Fall out mercury confetti
Ebony skies, I died already
Liquor store counting pennies
I'm in motion, do you savvy?
I exhume 'cause it relax me
Watch you think 'bout that? Don't fight it
Smell me though, fucker quiet
Cyclone in a gortex shell
Audio input for my spell
Show up for what? This cig's too plush
Long as my smokescreen's holding up
I hold this down like high contrast
Stills taken from shade on flash
I'm so shade tree it makes me laugh
Every time you reply that's fine

Caught a tiny cougar even she don't wet

Obey me
Obey me

I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me, obey me
I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me, obey me

Where's your heat at? It won't lit
I'm not surprised, check your thermostat, no digits
I drop a dime, you can have that, collect your tip
Go buy a rhyme and bring my cash back, you broke ass bitch

I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison

Never betray me, oh and while you're at it
Double my inhibitor, I can't hack it
Be my buffer, my habit hunger havoc
I digress, I can't live in this contagion
I spread into incisions on occasion
Heavily stricken witness visions
Omens wall to wall followed by a loss of any and all symptoms
It won't lit

Notice me, senpai

You're like, "Hold on. Fuck, it won't lit."
Stay put, you're the wrong one, bitch don't fit
Too shook, you're flows off blood, this won't hit
Got no hook, true or false, though you can't spit
Bitter face, Frida Kahlo the Costco remix, you're a case
All you got though free shit, what a waste
How can you not know? So which is it: love or hate?
You'd rather not know why shit won't lit, fucks hesitate

I sneak up on me
I shed my shh
My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me poison
Obey me, obey me
I sneak up on me

My shock, my body clear
Obey me poison

Obey me, obey me

Didn't mean to, I, I
Just assumed it'd be you, I, I
Never knew no idea, I, I
Was confused, excuses
It won't lit's a rubik's cubicle
For the new cog to chew off
To sulk with and flask on
How the sick with it put my mask on

Zach hit them off like, "It won't lit," they shit bricks
Bbpoltergeist don't touch this, don't insist
Favorite the copyright then go home, bitch, no homeless
I'm in your house like, "Oh shit, I own this"
I'll kick your ass out, don't bitch, bitch, it's winter, bitch
Take my trash out real quick or live in it
Where's my cash out promo slip? I'm skipping shit
When I'm tacked out, my it won't lit's it won't lit

I'm all up in my glory hole S-O no, no, no, no
Nylons on
Side bitches don't
Your table through my
My body through your
Three bedrooms in a good neighborhood
On fire like a margarita made out of wood
She got solar panels for thirty cents a watt
In the future, there's a party from the past, she's a cop

I'll jail break ADX with a blank tarot card
Same card pull your hoe card like Zoltar
Two crystal balls dangle from my boneyard
I'm Niagara Falls flowing crowbar
La la la la, I got Folsom bars
Tour flows urinal take a dive bars
Go down in the fifth you service town car
Swiftly service me, bitch it's called outlaw

Nylons on veal
Side bitches don't heal
Your table through my head
My body through your bed
I'm all up in my glory hole S-O no, no, no, no
I'm all up in my glory hole S-O no, no, no, no

Three bedrooms in a good neighborhood
On fire like a margarita made out of wood
She got solar panels for thirty cents a watt
In the future, there's a party from the past, she's a cop

This private ocean I carve
I'll carve this bitch into high art
No say bitch made state of mind art
My murder spree murk out this conk
Albert Fish gaunt sunk out this conk
Strictly ugly fuck for your cunt
Cunts over easy and more blunts
Thermal strong arm gravity sink bong
Head games with an only child
I foghorn devils devils jelly
Felt me, unbelt me, bombard your belly
Force feed me through your telly
Cyborg swelling pregnant can't abort

America, America, now I'm coming Africa
My death is money
Whose bad? His bad
Who's looking shitty? Not me
You think he's listening? Probably
Mouthpiece on Sally's like San Joaquin valley
Fuck your middle man, throw that towel in, you irk me
Yeah, yeah, go tell a friend
You're irrelevant, ain't shit but a skank
Skank way too far from her holding tank
Come on, girl, get your front on, girl
You rank A-list or so I hear
But no basic here, no safe bets here
Wouldn't touch a fake bitch with latex here

She's so, she's so
She know we know
She's

She's so, she's so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro
She's so, she's so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro

Party full of thirsty, lurkers hella worried
All in six high glass heels
Cinderella water hole climbing for a pot of goldie
Flip you for a twenty bill
Aim for El Dorado estimated arrival
Time it take a fuck to make a deal
Ain't gonna make it though, try your luck in porn
You're so thirsty, all you'll ever earn is frills

Check two skeeze
Pop that pussy pitch into a tent
How those poles make you so bent
Push that cart peddles you ring the bell
Ring the bell though, hands full of dick
Use your elbows, door to door you sand every last floor
Deep as you can choke a quicksand storm
Lipstick lap dance won't record

She's so, she's so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro
She's so, she's so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito

I'm doing handstands on her trans am
Pretty pretty nine, spinning spinning blind
Fitting into crime, itch to fuck and grind
Death Grips is online, drinking from its spine
Living till I'm fine, pretty pretty nine
Color me a cult, echo in my throat
Cut it for a smoke took it for a spin
Spun it out to float, blew me as a friend
Fuck it I'm a go, Death Grips is online
Black Madonna womb, collar for a goon
Suck it till you're stole, steal me a new role
Hunger of a chain through this mud cling
Don't let you pose on a blue rose
Lick a lick a grim set it chrome again
Chemical to learn load it up and gleam
Sprinter out a curve shooting up a scene
Bitter end to share, blotter in the air

Punks get nailed all in the daytime
And I got good friends who love to headline with a-

Pretty, pretty nine, pity, pity motherfucker
Pretty, pretty nine in your city, motherfucker
No laws here, airsoft start popping off
That flack get quit snitches wear
Pretty, pretty nine, pretty, pretty nine

Punks get nailed all in the daytime
And I got good friends who love to headline with a-

Dirty, dirty, strip mall sugar
Melody to hail, symphony to dick
Jealousy to file, entropy to flip
Felony, you buy, indica, I rip
Hella, hella hot flagging like I'm not
Vanish as I can damage as I been
Ultra other shit minus all the trim
Catalyst to milk, memory to stiff
Break it to the hilt, fuck it like a kiss
Paper tiger boss, pussy wanna front
Shake it like the law, only cool to hunt
Take it like a hint, miss it, get the dick
Climber, get a jerk, super ape as shit
Nightly on a tram, knuckle white the stance
Phaedra 'hind the cam work us in a trance
Lock us in her van, drive us outer space
Day we never land, only thing I'll taste

Punks get nailed all in the daytime
And I got some friends who'd love to headline with a-

Pretty, pretty nine, pity, pity motherfucker
Pretty, pretty nine, in your city, motherfucker
No laws here, airsoft start popping off

Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, together's unwise, sever all ties

Flies vomit me, vomit green eyes

Half-lidded coolers, half lies as cures
Warm blanket statement, Denver air terminal patient
Rubberized, skin rubberized
For your entertainment, got two cents save it
Dozing at the helm, road paved with vagrants
Closed casket make up, lavish euthanasia
Necro Winnebago, worship on shroom in safe zones
Hilo loose brown recluse, murdered out rainbows

Can't hear answer I, try for wait signal my
Wait for my signal try, too late to whisper why
Besides don't waste this fry, had to take it all at once
As yet unknown, as yet as fuck, back in the town
Now what, know what, no rush
So what, what now, fuck now

Blackish green spirits of Krak√≥w (Reptilism)
Only fog I've felt with features
Exception complexion of silver drinkers
Oppressive dense fog with modest demeanor

Should the opportunity arise, vomit me flies
Flies vomit me, together's unwise, sever all ties

Trust me trust me you know us well
We purge herds of stunted cells
We nurse the worm until it swells
(Eat it like the devil's cunt)
First to kneel cursed to feel
Trust me trust us we know you will
Tide come crashing in like steel
Makes your passions taste so stale
(Eat it like the devil's cunt)
Cobwebs turn your insides pale

If significant piece of me spill
Little pinot pouring out my gills
Pass a carafe perhaps I'll swill
My grief may leak but can't congeal
Word nihil you know the drill
To last rattle on a long swig tail
Till last drop wind through mine like scales
Compromise your position become theirs

Day breaking glyph hissing
Sanity fucking bitch skinning
How do you say come to me
Hanging out with Linda
I heard she's in fucking custody

Need new escape we're a trained magician
I've just the uranium griffin
Land you there in ribbons
Where your thoughts stay hidden
Fair for a square made soft for digging
Word nihil you know the drill
Amp cooking guilt gives a
Thunder stealing window licker
Her moods big for real
Head hunting blunt kissing
Death dumping body gripping

Head hunting blunt kissing
Death dumping body gripping
How does she say come to me
Boosting with Linda's in custody

Must admit shit's not luck how we
Manage to elude locked up in county
Every chance a fuck gets I'm counting
Sleight of hand sleight of hand from the valley

Word nihil you know the drill
Eat it like the devil's cunt
Burns whoever she kills
Eat it like the devil's cunt

Destroyer

I'm at Glow Bowl, in a wet fuck hole
Where the 1994 hobos throw
69's and the bitches shout
I'll fuck you when I wanna hang out
Tell the princess eat shit and die (ownage)
Not in public, hoe, I'm still high
These pigs are crazy, dog
This narc at the dyke bar in a slow car
Looking like a hedgehog
Sluts go sonic (ownage)
Tryna dick your mom and shit
I'll do anal in the pit
Repulsive as a benched knick
Show your titties and I'll spit
These chicks are crazy, god

Hate you on a fucking whim, turning into you again
These pigs are crazy, dog
Make a god a better man, no one hates you better than
These chicks are crazy, god
You're so amazing, ha

Ha-ha-ha, bitch

Ha-ha-ha, bitch

Kiss me

It's my Liberace starter kit
Got her hard like Spartacus
Put a bitch under my wing-a-ling-a-lang-lang-lang
Look bitch, fly like thus
Dope man's dry, oh yeah right
Don't trip mark, yo this my part
I got green David Letterman's, dick like zen
Remember when you fainted at the bargain bins
Party time (ownage)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Good news to hell
My Toyota with some bells (ownage)
Pussy so wise
She's trying to bump two queen drugs right between the eyes
Ownage, ownage, ownage, ownage

In a wet fuck hole
With my feet kicked up so my hair can grow
My steeze is crazy, dog
And I'm in bitch house
Talking 'bout how I'm not tryna hang out
Her steeze is crazy, dog
(Who could it be?
W-w-w-who could it be?
W-w-w-who could it be?)
I think I'm crazy, dog
Put a bitch under my wing-a-ling-a-lang-lang-lang
Put a bitch under my wing-a-ling-a-lang-lang-lang

Pint of snake blood heat you on one

Head for this lap put my hands up
Weightless glisten press the cactus

Lead when it's played like it is fry

This hole's a break through this new door
Waste of all day of a shit show
It's a shit show (Front row)

Streaky
Streaky, streaky, streaky
Streaky
Streaky, streaky, streaky, yeah

Streaky on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Southside, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Streaky on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Booty on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Southside, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Booty on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Flag full of backslide

How I heard about, she's a walkabout
Dream time announced
Don't leave your shit around, what
Take me to the bank, certified amount
How I heard about, she's a walkabout
Dream time announced
Booty on the outside

Can't double back, double stack, triple stack, jetpack
Low crack, low sale, grand prize, pay 'em gram, can't lag
Might pay to feed that, speed gap (oh my)
Lost highway, speed neck, seek Jane
On deck with no grease trap
High stake that, one-take track, can't fake that
Cut it back, go back, back, take that

Flag full of backslide
Bye-bye, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Streaky on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)

Booty on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Booty on the outside

Keratin on pants dried, good to paraglide, blare a fie
Surfin' through a tail pipe
Stick shift stun drive, turn on a tail light, sail like
Learn you how to dead right
Bounce with no downside, down for that joyride
Ghostride, bouta do a no rod
Low ride, grip it like a cheetah fly
Bonafide creeper type

Streaky on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise
Southside, do me 'cause it sounds tight
Streaky on the outside
Oh my (yuh), oh my (yuh)
Booty on the outside
Stand by, dealer hold a franchise

February 20th, Los Angeles, California
I'm in the studio with Death Grips
They're working on their new album at Sunset Sound Studios
6650 Sunset Boulevard
They have a dilemma, but they'll win their dilemma

Dilemma

Butterfly ballistic, seax survival
Butcher kukri to trench homicidal
Can't say I buy them, just show up lately
Lately seem to stalk me like I'm yeti
Like scream of a haunted jetty
Let me be a haunted jetty
Cross I cry banshee like manic falcon
Shrill like losing time on Shasta Mountain

Thingany thingany, so jinx now
She's wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wild
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style

Shine like sad hung from starry eyed gallows
Like day old glow of carbon eye shadow
Trembling young wounded mammal
Double edge gut judge choke on his gavel (Choke)
Jack slide leave atlantic puddles
Spade slip lives into stranded shuttles
I taxiderm shams with morbid shinto
This three quarter shank, one quarter disco (Choke)
Low res mega evil patina
Pattern maker of myth and trip weaver
Infamous nature in rags like reaper
Like midnight mounted by wayside seekers

Lovely, lovely, they're so blonde
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
Dusty, dusty, so far gone
I'm fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fucking wrong

It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
It's ah-ah-ah-ah-on and on
These knives bleed knives
They cut me, I'll cut you
Below is above you
Above is below me
I'm dying to try on these knives
You don't know me

Dilemma
Dilemma

Thingany thingany, so jinx now
She's wahwah wah-wah-wah-wild
Pinky ring, pinky ring, show it out
My suh-suh-suh-suh-suh style

Little Richard took a picture
He got triggered by the click'a
He got beat up, he got bigger

Little Richard
Little Richard

Little Richard, he's in the dorms
He's gonna bomb and look good when he bombs
In the dorms
Maria Sharapova, yes
As good as anyone's guess

Little Richard
Little Richard

He just needs to A, B, C, and D
He just needs the world to be what he has seen

In the horn section
They hide weapons
Bottom of a white bic
Chewed up like a pig's dick

Little Richard

I don't know dude, I just-I just drink blood dude

The fear (jump, jump, jump)
I'm gonna kill somebody (jump, jump, jump)
Don't jump!

Downs you with dull pain
Won't we become strange
Tied up with your legs
Hide helps, on the way
Who will help you fall?
It's just all so frail
So long since we fell
Still don't know we failed
Go for the most tears
Stay cause it gets strange
Went there to shed years
Left there in lead chains
Been there since next year
Scarred us to death chair
Scared us to rest less
Skull full of house guests

The fear
The fear

I feel so sick today
I'm afraid to be here with you
You wanna kill somebody
I'm afraid to be here with you
I feel so sick today
I'm afraid to be here with you
You wanna kill somebody
I'm afraid to be here with you

Don't jump!
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
The fear

Pulled close by its pliers
Cold, sharp, and expired
Like ribs of vampire
Like winds on high wire
Whips you like it cares
Push you down more stairs
Kicks you for quick laughs
Don't cry you won't last (The fear)
Missing entire weeks
Months gone as I peak
Lost tongue, mystery
Everyone's on to me (The fear)
Who's this stole my heels
Stumbled into hell
Hates me till it heals
Wakes me with the chills (The fear)

I feel so sick today
I'm afraid to be here with you
You wanna kill somebody
I'm afraid to be here with you
I feel so sick today
I'm afraid to be here with you
You wanna kill somebody
I'm afraid to be here with you

Frightening and embarrassing
Like one percent and pleasantries
Gather your things bolt till you reach
The crystal fields of ketamine
I'll meet you there, I'll beat you there
Bet I'll be there before you leave
Time you get there I'll be midair
Like peace of mind's a bore to me

The fear
The fear
Jump, jump
Don't jump!

When the rail holds you
Flight like stairs grows you
Off your mind must wish
This is not my ditch
Ah that ditch wears you
Host torn and worn through
Hard looks at blank walls
Held way too long pause
The fear
The fear

Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed

Called shots cheap shots
Slack jaws low blows
Weak chins chin checked
Chin up like cholos
No life signs left
Ah yes, try mine
This thresh hold thresh
Hold stretch life times
Machine human malformed machine
Uninformed unit forlorn regime
Metamorph me into done for at last
At least until my present shore has passed

Why me?
Why me?
Why me?
Why me?
Why me?!

Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed

Nut job, no job
Fuck jobs, not hired
Low lands, road rash
War path crossfire
Nonthreats, hot mess
Known threats, stalk less
Talk less, show less
Snatch yours trap doors
Ripper ripper skin tight, too tight
Too tight holding solid moonlight moonlight
Moonlight, kevlar coated slit moon, lunar gush
Lunar gush carry on carrion never been far enough
Hocus breaking in and centering
Broke in and gave up on everything, everything

Why me?!
Why me?
Why me?
Why me?
Why me?

Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, disappointed

Rot clot corpse clutch
Corpse clot your husk
Scorned husk born shook
Torn trick core breached
Shook fuck shit head
Bitch too short street
Shut fuck up or fed
Both you're

Disappointed
