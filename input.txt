We bring this for the ones who fiend to see the truth taken back in pain
The weakness of this scene who fucks who lack the nuts to claim
The streets from which that real shit comes to push you up on game
What's your name check it bitch it's Death Grips

Gut around big anti-sleeping no half-stepping low life
Creepin' high-def freaking detonation
Set it off no hesitation audio invasion
But fuck that can't thrust that to a beam
That shit had to go machine that lick
And let 'em blow like cream black it's the magic host
Self ream tactic what's the fuck I mean that shit
All night

Executors of that next shit
Nest eye to the left shit
That melt your face
Till your bloody neck gets ripped headless
Death grips
Bow down and take this what you get bitch
Rest in bits as I pace up and down the low end of the bass
Stomping rounds automatic fire sounds in your face
Rip them fakes out their flesh
Come test this get this straight no escape
Rigor mortis death break
Strung up in the hung wire hell tensity drum
Bitch slap negative space
You thought that it makes through a cut
That bit only info can create
To properly uno dos tr√©s

Ride through your skull

Took hit to the face take way off the hook don't hate
Shook out your footsteps and put back in your place
Triple X heat the rain in which we move
While they choose to get used everyday
Running highs you might break if their own reek of fear
Why you wish we were here
While I say get the fuck out my way
For to get cut by fist gut if you stay

Thought you was on top but not no more
That's right whore we're fucking you
We're fucking you
Thought you knew me had shit locked to the beat street don't stop
Licking shots for the old school freaks doing the robot
Hear this devil spit next lower heat blow it out your spine

Fear high drop to your knees trick you know what we want
That's right bitch best believe this that shit you forgot
Ever was but it is through my blood need that fix
Gotta catch that but lead off that high head row
Give it 'em like it step back 'cause need to rip that watch me bust
Where you going not knowing till we get there jack 'em off of this
The sword what you're holding till you get well
Have to hit 'em off with all you know
And got that gold and make it cracked again
Control this while I hold this enema death takes that my casket in
Growing like oceans epileptic sex can't get passed this shit
Spiraling too much on like king of the cleaners liquid acid trip

What's up with that next shit
It's death grips

Illegal spit fire bum rushing ya tires
This fuck give it up I'm here look don't touch why
We're done and whip that fuck you
I'll cut you don't try it can't deny it
Cracks off every time that you bite it
Try to fuck when I don't buy it

What's up with that next shit
It's death grips

Try to board this train like
What's ya name check it bitch
Jack the rip in a brain
That's just shrunken head trip
What's ya name tic tacking
Just just status

Nuclear fallout flesh in fire in the hole
Death Grips is some thrash it goes right through your skull
<|endoftext|>
Face melter
Cock the barrel, trigger range
Swerving donuts 'gainst the grain
I blame ghost rider, whips the brain
Kaleidoscopic bullet train
Never gave up, just a clutch
Bitch

Burn a bitch and burn that strip to dust
Dust to ashes, ash to mush
Mashed off the madness man, combust
Black magic flames race out because they forgot they can't get down enough
Low to the ground limbo, don't touch this merchandise, it's way too much
Ride the currents like a snake, wicked rhymes
Whirlpools I'll wade through haters, posers, fools, and flakes
Through this breaks the rules it takes
But I not just bump what you waste your time and money tryin' to chase

Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream
(Madness)

Don't trip man, just know we come
And won't even be close to done
Till shit hit the fan and make that flesh melt off your plastic face
Kill it till it dies, don't stop it until you feel that flatline drop
To hell and back, fuck yeah, why not?
(Why not?)
Smash till I break out, can't stop, won't stop, don't stop
Ghosts can't get caught, run it back, get cracked to the beat one time
Get-get-get back, keep in sync rhymes
Endorphins cashed by your own time
I'm coughing, the track freeze and unwind
Weed is of kind vaporize
Freak man down from way this rides, how this rides
Feet don't touch the ground inside, I twist the rhythm pounds 'em on
How measurements of sound rewind
Forever and a day forgot
Forget to let it bang and walk the plank
That hang from slang concocted to destroy the frame got bent by globe
This takes the pain in shock
(Ah!)

Don't know why you're wasting time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

Execution makes it hot, electrocute the wave, the shock
To the brains of heads that came to watch us
Claim the game haters can't knock us
Real ones bring that bloody bass, we came to melt your fucking face
You can keep it, I don't want it
Back, my only inside pocket
All up on it, man get off it
Can't you see me? Best to drop it
Cut it, quit it, quick, next topic
How we fuck it off and rock it
Paradox knot, disco sock it
Can't unplug it with your logic
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Fuck it
And unplug it with your -
Take out your eyes and watch it
Make you cry, feel like I lost it
Didn't lose it, never had it
Just another clueless faggot
Bound and gagged by fear
Too pathetic to be tragic
Get that shit outta here

Don't know why you waste your time, just know what I do with mine
How to do impossible things
How to do impossible things
What does happiness really mean?
Where to go when abrupt woken up from the dream

I can't deny I've not the slightest idea why
Even attempt to try
See them sigh
And settle with knowing barely enough to get by
Automatic supernova, so what?
(Automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic, automatic)
We'll storm in the gates, subatomic
Flame drippin' onto this coal, setting hellfire to your face

Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter, face melter
Helter Skelter
